# General Information

Pro3D is an Android app for creating 3D models from a set of images. Made for a school project it's UI is simple and it lacks many of the features you would expect on a desktop equivalent to this app. However, it has a full SFM (structure from motion) workflow and unlike similar competitors in the Android market, it is free and open source.
